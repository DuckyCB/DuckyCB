# Hello there.

If you've stumbled upon my profile, you must be exploring the depths of the internet. Don't worry, you're not lost yet... hopefully.

## 🦆 About me

- I'm a software engineering student from Uruguay.
- I love **open source**, **performance**, **privacy** and **security**. 
- When I grow up I want to be like Elliot Alderson (but normalish).

## 📖 Learning

- Advanced Go features 🐹
- Security related things 🔐 (_Mom come pick me up I'm scared_)

## 📋 Software I use

- Fedora 🎩 (btw I don't use Arch)
- Gnome 🐾
- WebStorm 🌩 | Zed 🔲 | VSCodium 🪸 | Neovim 🇳
- Obsidian 🪨
- Firefox 🦊 | Brave 🦁

## Self-Hosting

I use a lot of self hosted services including Forgejo, so most of my code is not AI scraper friendly (sorry stakeholders)
